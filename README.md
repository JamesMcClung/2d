# 2D Standard

This repo contains "official" versions of 2D spells.

The standard object structure is given at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JmN3yyxtMsPsqc20GxxeTw9YhY3F9wwHr4dod5K15Go/edit.

The yaml style can be reproduced with `js-yaml` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml) using the dump options `{ sortKeys: true, lineWidth: Infinity }`.
